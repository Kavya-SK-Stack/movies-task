# Movies Search Application


### This is my revamped project with pagination now activated. I have fixed the pagination issue. 


A movie search application built with React, Tailwind CSS, and the OMDB API.


## HomePage 
- Popular movies are displayed statically to showcase the homepage.
- They won't link to the Movie Detail Page.
- Users can search for their favorite movies and view details for a particular movie.

## Features
- Search for movies, series, or episodes.
- View movie details with a poster, plot, and ratings.
- Dropdown filter for content type.
- Pagination support for large datasets.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Add your OMDB API key in `src/services/api.js`.
4. Run locally: `npm run dev`.

## Deployment
- Deploy to Netlify using `npm run build`.
